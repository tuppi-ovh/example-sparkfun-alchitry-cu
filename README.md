# Example Sparkfun Alchitry CU

## Introduction

The aim of this repository is to try to implement SpinalHDL designs from scratch as possible going from a very simple one (LED blinking) to a more complex one (SoC with VexRiscv processor).

## Compilation

- `make all`: translate spinalHDL to verilog, synthetize, place and route.

- `make time`: show timing critical path. 

- `make clean`: clean up compilation result.

## Simple Blink Design 

This design makes one board LED to blink with randomly choosen on / off time.

## Apb Blink Design 

In this design I start to use a APB bus to set the LEDs state.

## Hello World Design

In this design I connect UART to the APB bus with a simple state machine to handle commands.
